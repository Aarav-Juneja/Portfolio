Hi, I'm Aarav Juneja, a freshman in high school. For this first post, I would like to give a general overview of my interests, passions, and what I spend my time on.

## Programming
Programming is definitely 99% of me. This website right here has been programmed 100% by me with no template.

### Low-level
I learned C from the basics in CS50x. I've been learning various small features throughout my hacking journey and as a 'useful skill'.
Recently, I started to use this skill in USACO. I am currently USACO Silver and am aiming for Gold by sophmore year.

### Web Dev
Web Dev is where it all started. Like many others, I took the Ultimate Web Development Bootcamp from Udemy. I use Node.js for my backend and have used various frontend frameworks. There isn't any point in listing them; the important thing is that I'll learn it if needed and have probably researched it before.

### Miscellaneous
Currently I'm in my school's robotics team(very advanced), so I have been studying Kalman filters, MPPI, YOLO, OpenCV, and Serial ports along with anything else they can find.

## Cybersecurity
As much as I love making things, I also like breaking things. Cybersecurity really came out of nowhere because it seemed cool, and like a fun thing to do.
Using Hack the Box, I have slowly learned common techniques and how to break into the average website.

## Physics
In early sixth grade, I started studying science bowl. By 7th grade, I was spending hours a day studying physics, chemistry, and math. This competiton really dominated my middle school years.
In high school, I decided to focus my efforts more directly on physics. I have been reading a calculus-based textbook and recently took the F=ma exam.

## Conclusion
This blog space is going to be used for me explain things I don't understand to other people, and also highlight my projects.
